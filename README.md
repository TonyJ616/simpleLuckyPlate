# simpleLuckyPlate

## This is a little web application which implemented some basic functions of a 'lucky plate'.

The count of prize classes range from 2 to 5, with an additional 'Thank you for play' class. You can input a name for 
each prize class(this is not required), and a probability for each class. The probability has the unit of % and should add up to 100.
After setting, click 'save' then the lucky plate will be painted according to the probability and the color before their titles. 
Click the 'Start' button, the cursor will start rotating and stop in a random time.
It now does not include a data-saving function.
